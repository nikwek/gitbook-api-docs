# Metrics

Metrics represent the individual time-series sent to the AppOptics service. Each measurement sent to AppOptics is associated with a Metric.

#### Metric Properties

Parameter | Definition
--------- | ----------
type | Type of metric to create (gauge, counter, or composite).
display_name<br>`optional` | Name which will be used for the metric when viewing the Metrics website.
description<br>`optional` | Text that can be used to explain precisely what the gauge is measuring.
period<br>`optional` | Number of seconds that is the standard reporting period of the metric. Setting the period enables Metrics to detect abnormal interruptions in reporting and aids in analytics. For gauge metrics that have service-side aggregation enabled, this option will define the period that aggregation occurs on.
attributes<br>`optional` | The attributes hash configures specific components of a metric's visualization. A list of metric attributes can be found in the [Metric Attributes table](#attributes).
composite<br>`optional` | The composite definition. Only used when type is composite.

## Create a Metric

>Create a metric named `cpu.percent.used` matching the tags `environment:prod` and `service:api`:

```bash
curl \
-u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "type": "gauge",
  "name": "cpu.percent.used",
  "period": 60,
  "attributes": {
    "summarize_function": "sum",
    "color": "#FFFFFF"
  },
  "tags": {
    "environment": "prod",
    "service": "api"
  }
}' \
-X PUT \
'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/cpu.percent.used'
```
Metrics can be created without submitting a measurement value using a PUT to the `/metrics` endpoint.
Metrics are automatically created by POSTing a measurement for the first time. See [Create a Measurement](#create-a-measurement).

#### HTTP Request

`PUT https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/:name`

#### Headers

This specifies the format of the data sent to the API.

For HTML (default):

`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

For JSON:

`Content-Type: application/json`

### Creating Persisted Composite Metrics

>Create a persisted composite named `cpu.percent.used` matching the tags `environment:prod` and `service:api`:

```bash
curl \
-u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "type": "composite",
  "name": "cpu.percent.used",
  "composite": "s(\"cpu.percent.user\", {\"environment\" : \"prod\", \"service\": \"api\"})"
}' \
-X PUT \
'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/cpu.percent.used'
```

```ruby
Not yet available
```

```python
Not yet available
```

> Response Body

```
{
  "name": "cpu.percent.used",
  "display_name": null,
  "type": "composite",
  "description": null,
  "period": null,
  "source_lag": null,
  "composite": "s(\"cpu.percent.user\", {\"environment\" : \"prod\", \"service\": \"api\"})"
}
```

#### HTTP Request

`POST https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/:name`

With this route you can also create and update persisted [composite metrics](https://www.appoptics.com/docs/kb/data_processing/composite_specification/). This allows you to save and use a composite definition as if it was a normal metric. To create a persisted composite set the `type` to composite and provide a composite definition in the `composite` parameter. A named metric will be created that can be used on instruments or alerts, similar to how you would use a regular metric.

## Retrieve a Metric

The AppOptics API lets you search for metric metadata and measurements within the system. For example, you could query a list of all available metrics in the system or those matching a specific naming pattern.

### Retrieve a Metric by Name

>How to retrieve the metadata for the metric `cpu_temp`:

```bash
curl \
  -i \
  -u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
  -X GET \
  'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/cpu_temp'
```

```ruby
require "appoptics/metrics"
AppOptics::Metrics.authenticate <token>
AppOptics::Metrics.get_metric :cpu_temp
```

```python
import librato
api = librato.connect(<user>, <token>)
metric = api.get("cpu_temp")
print(metric.attributes)
```

>Response Body:

```json
{
  "name": "cpu_temp",
  "display_name": "cpu_temp",
  "description": "Current CPU temperature in Fahrenheit",
  "period": 60,
  "type": "gauge",
  "attributes": {
    "created_by_ua": "librato-metrics/0.7.4 (ruby; 1.9.3p194; x86_64-linux) direct-faraday/0.8.4",

```

>Response Headers

```
Location: <job-checking URI>  # issued only for 202
```

Update the [properties](#metrics) and/or [attributes](#metric-attributes) of a set of metrics at the same time.

This route accepts either a list of metric names OR a single pattern which includes wildcards (`*`).

There are two potential success states for this action, either a `204 No Content` (all changes are complete) or a `202 Accepted`.

A `202` will be issued when the metric set is large enough that it cannot be operated on immediately. In those cases a `Location`: response header will be included which identifies a [Job resource](#jobs) which can be monitored to determine when the operation is complete and if it has been successful.

#### Headers

This specifies the format of the data sent to the API.

For HTML (default):

`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

For JSON:

`Content-Type: application/json`

### Update a Metric by Name

>Update the existing metric temp by setting the display_name and the minimum display attribute.

```bash
curl \
  -u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
  -d 'display_name=Temperature in Celsius&attributes[display_min]=0' \
  -X PUT \
  'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/temp'
```

```ruby
require "appoptics/metrics"
AppOptics::Metrics.authenticate <token>
AppOptics::Metrics.update_metric :temp, name: "Temperature in Celsius", attributes: { display_min: '0' }
```

```python
import librato
api = librato.connect(<user>, <token>)
for metric in api.list_metrics(name="temp"):
  gauge = api.get(metric.name)
  attrs = gauge.attributes
  attrs['display_name'] = 'Temperature in Celsius'
  attrs['display_min'] = '0'
  api.update(metric.name, attributes=attrs)
```

>Response Code

```
204 No Content
```

>Create a metric named `queue_len` (this assumes the metric does not exist):

```bash
curl \
  -u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
  -d 'type=gauge&description=Length of app queue&display_name=num. elements' \
  -X PUT \
  'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/queue_len'
```

```ruby

AppOptics::Metrics.authenticate <token>
AppOptics::Metrics.update_metric :queue_len, type: :gauge, display_name: "num. elements", period: 15
```

```python
import librato
api = librato.connect(<user>, <token>)
api.submit("queue_len", 10)
```

>Response Code

```
201 Created
```

>Response Headers

```
Location: /v1/metrics/queue_len
```

>Response Body

```json

  }
}
```

#### HTTP Request

`PUT https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/:name`

Updates or creates the metric identified by `name`. If the metric already exists, it performs an update of the metric's properties.

If the metric name does not exist, then the metric will be created with the associated properties. Normally metrics are created the first time a measurement is sent to the [collated POST route](#create-a-metric), after which their properties can be updated with this route. However, sometimes it is useful to set the metric properties before the metric has received any measurements so this will create the metric if it does not exist.

## Delete a Metric

#### HTTP Request

`DELETE https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics`

> Delete the metrics `cpu`, `servers` and `reqs`:

```bash
curl \
  -u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
  -d 'names%5B%5D=cpu&names%5B%5D=servers&names%5B%5D=reqs' \
  -X DELETE \
  'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics'
```

```ruby
require "appoptics/metrics"
AppOptics::Metrics.authenticate <token>
AppOptics::Metrics.delete_metrics :cpu, :servers, :reqs
```

```python
import librato
api = librato.connect(<user>, <token>)
api.delete(names=['cpu', 'servers', 'reqs'])
```

>Delete all metrics that start with `cpu` and end with `.90`:

```bash
curl \
  -u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
  -d 'names=cpu*.90' \
  -X DELETE \
  'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics'
```

```ruby
require "appoptics/metrics"
AppOptics::Metrics.authenticate <token>
AppOptics::Metrics.delete_metrics names: ["cpu*.90"]
```

```python
Not available
```

>Response Code

```
204 No Content OR 202 Accepted
```

>Response Headers

```
Location: <job-checking URI>  # issued only for 202
```

Batch-delete a set of metrics. Both the metrics and all of their measurements will be removed. All data deleted will be unrecoverable, so use this with care.

This route accepts either a list of metric names OR a single pattern which includes wildcards (`*`).

If you post measurements to a metric name after deleting the metric, that metric will be re-created as a new metric with measurements starting from that point.

There are two potential success states for this action, either a `204 No Content` (all changes are complete) or a `202 Accepted`.

A `202` will be issued when the metric set is large enough that it cannot be operated on immediately. In those cases a `Location`: response header will be included which identifies a [Job resource](#jobs) which can be monitored to determine when the operation is complete and if it has been successful.

<aside class="notice">If you have attempted to DELETE a metric but it is still in your metric list, ensure that you are not continuing to submit measurements to the metric you are trying to delete.</aside>

### Delete a Metric by Name

#### HTTP Request

`DELETE https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/:name`


>Delete the metric named `app_requests`.

```bash
curl \
  -i \
  -u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
  -X DELETE \
  'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/metrics/app_requests'
```

```ruby
require "appoptics/metrics"
AppOptics::Metrics.authenticate <token>
AppOptics::Metrics.delete_metrics :app_requests
```

```python
import librato
api = librato.connect(<user>, <token>)
api.delete("app_requests")
```

>Response Code

```
204 No Content
```

Delete the metric identified by :name. This will delete both the metric and all of its measurements.

If you post measurements to a metric name after deleting the metric, that metric will be re-created as a new metric with measurements starting from that point.

If you have attempted to DELETE a metric but it is still in your metric list, ensure that you are not continuing to submit measurements to the metric you are trying to delete.
