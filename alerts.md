# Alerts

Alerts are used to build actionable responses to changes in metric measurements. Alerts define conditions on the input measurements and are triggered when the value(s) of the input measurements cross a threshold or stop reporting. For example, an alert could be used to notify an administrator that response time for a given service is elevated above an acceptable range.

## The Alert Object

### Alerts Properties

Alert Property | Definition
-------------- | ----------
id | Each alert has a unique numeric ID.
name | A unique name used to identify the alert. Must be 255 or fewer characters, and may only consist of `A-Za-z0-9.:-`. Dotted decimal notation (e.g. `production.web.frontend.responsetime`) is recommended.
conditions | An array of conditions hashes (properties described in the [overview](#alerts)). NOTE: conditions are required for PUT operations.
services | An array of [services](#services) to notify for this alert (sent as list of IDs).
attributes | A key-value hash of metadata for the alert (described in alert attributes).
description | A string describing this alert.
active | Boolean: identifies whether the alert is active (can be triggered). Defaults to true.
rearm_seconds | Specifies the minimum amount of time between sending alert notifications, in seconds. A notification will be sent once the alert is triggered, and then will not be sent again until the rearm timer has elapsed, even if more measurements are received that would trigger the alert. Required to be a multiple of 60, and when unset or null will default to 600 (10 minutes).

### Alert Conditions

Each alert can have multiple alert conditions, each of which specifies a state which must be met for the alert to fire. Note an alert will fire when ALL alert conditions are met, not when a single condition is met.

We currently support three alert condition types:

Condition | Definition
--------- | ----------
above | Condition is met when the stream goes above the specified threshold.
absent | Condition is met when the stream does not send a measurement for duration seconds.
below | Condition is met when the stream goes below the specified threshold.

All alert conditions have the following properties:

Property | Definition
-------- | ----------
type | One of above, absent, or below.
metric_name | The name of the metric this alert condition applies to.
tags<br>`optional` | A set of key/value pairs that describe the particular data stream. Tags behave as extra dimensions that data streams can be filtered and aggregated along. Examples include the region a server is located in, the size of a cloud instance or the country a user registers from. The full set of unique tag pairs defines a single data stream. Wildcards can be used here (e.g. prod-* will include all tags that begin with prod-). Data Streams matching the specified tag set can be grouped with the property `"grouped":true`. If left false each data stream matching the tag set will be evaluated individually.
detect_reset | *boolean*: If the summary_function is "derivative", this toggles the method used to calculate the delta from the previous sample. When set to "false" (default), the delta is calculated as simple subtraction of current - previous. <br><br>If "true" only increasing (positive) values will be reported. Any time the current value is less than the previous it is considered a reset of the counter and a derivative of zero is reported. This field is ignored for any setting of summary_function other than "derivative".

Additional properties for the 'above' alert condition type:

Property | Definition
-------------- | ----------
threshold | float: measurements over this number will fire the alert.
summary_function<br>`optional` | string: Indicates which statistic of an aggregated measurement to alert on. <br><br>For gauge metrics will default to "average", which is also the "value" of non-complex or un-aggregated measurements. If set, must be one of: [min, max, average, sum, count, derivative]. See [Instrument Stream Property summary_function](#instruments) for more details.
duration | *integer*: Number of seconds that data for the specified metric/tag combination must be above the threshold for before the condition is met. All data points within the given duration must be above the threshold to meet this condition. This avoids a single spike from triggering the condition. <br><br>If unset, a single sample above the threshold will trigger the condition. The tracking duration begins with samples received after the alert condition is created or updated. Must be >= 60 seconds and <= 3600 seconds.

Additional properties for the 'absent' alert condition type:

Alert Property | Definition
-------------- | ----------
duration | *integer*: How many seconds data for the specified metric/tag combination must not be missing before the condition is met. This will only trigger for a given metric/tag combination after a measurement has been seen at least once. Must be >= 60 seconds and <= 3600 seconds. (Required)

Additional properties for the 'below' alert condition type:

Alert Property | Definition
-------------- | ----------
threshold | *float*: measurements below this number will fire the alert. (Required)
summary_function | *string*: Indicates which statistic of an aggregated measurement to alert on. <br><br>For gauge metrics will default to "average", which is also the "value" of non-complex or un-aggregated measurements. If set, must be one of: [min, max, average, sum, count, derivative]. See [Instrument Stream Property](instruments) `summary_function` for more details.
duration | *integer*: Number of seconds that data for the specified metric/tag combination must be below the threshold for before the condition is met. All data points within the given duration must be below the threshold to meet this condition. This avoids a single drop from triggering the condition. <br><br>If unset, a single sample below the threshold will trigger the condition. The tracking duration begins with samples received after the alert condition is created or updated. Must be >= 60 seconds and <= 3600 seconds.

#### Alert Attributes

The attributes field on the alert accepts an optional map of key-value pairs and allows metadata to be associated with the alert. Some keys are used for special behavior:

Attribute | Definition
--------- | ----------
runbook_url | a URL for the runbook to be followed when this alert is firing. Used in the AppOptics UI if set.

Attributes can be unset by excluding their key when updating an alert.

## Create an Alert

>Create an alert named `production.web.frontend.response_time` with one condition which monitors the metric `web.nginx.response_time` and alerts whenever the value goes over 200.

>When the alert is triggered, the service identified by ID 849 (a Slack channel in this case) will be notified.

Update the specified alert.

#### HTTP Request

`PUT https://api.appoptics.com/v1/alerts/:id`

#### Headers

This specifies the format of the data sent to the API.

For HTML (default):

`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

For JSON:

`Content-Type: application/json`

#### Parameters

Parameter | Definition
--------- | ----------
name | A unique name used to identify the alert. Must be 255 or fewer characters, and may only consist of `A-Za-z0-9.:-`. Dotted decimal notation (e.g. `production.web.frontend.responsetime`) is recommended.
conditions | An array of conditions hashes (properties described in the [overview](#alerts)). NOTE: conditions are required for PUT operations.
services | An array of [services](#services) to notify for this alert (sent as list of IDs).
attributes<br>`optional` | A key-value hash of metadata for the alert (described in alert attributes).
description<br>`optional` | A string describing this alert.
active<br>`optional` | Boolean: identifies whether the alert is active (can be triggered). Defaults to true.
rearm_seconds<br>`optional` | Specifies the minimum amount of time between sending alert notifications, in seconds. A notification will be sent once the alert is triggered, and then will not be sent again until the rearm timer has elapsed, even if more measurements are received that would trigger the alert. Required to be a multiple of 60, and when unset or null will default to 600 (10 minutes).

## Notification Services

AppOptics provides many [notification services](https://www.appoptics.com/docs/kb/alert/alerts-intro/#notification-services) to alert your team by when an alert is triggered. At least one (but not lmiited to one) service must be tied to each alert.

### Associate a Service with an Alert

>Add the service identified by `ID 290` to the alert "my.alert.name" (ID `45`). When the alert is triggered, the service `290` will be notified.

>Note: To get a list of created services, view the section on [Retrieving all services](#retrieve-all-services).

```bash
curl \
  -u $APPOPTICS_TOKEN: \
  -d 'service=290' \
  -X POST \
  'https://api.appoptics.com/v1/alerts/45/services'
