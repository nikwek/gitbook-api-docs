# Measurements

Measurements represent the individual time-series samples sent to the Librato service. They are associated with a metric, one or more tag pairs, and a point in time.

Each measurement has a value that represents an observation at one point in time. The value of a measurement will typically vary between some minimum or maximum value (ex. CPU usage moving from 0% to 100%).


### Measurement Properties

The general properties of a measurement are described below. The [documentation on submitting measurements](#create-a-measurement) includes a full overview of all acceptable parameters.

Property | Definition
-------- | ----------
name | The unique identifying name of the property being tracked. The metric name is used both to create new measurements and query existing measurements.
tags | A set of key/value pairs that describe the particular data stream. Tags behave as extra dimensions that data streams can be filtered and aggregated along. Examples include the region a server is located in, the size of a cloud instance or the country a user registers from. The full set of unique tag pairs defines a single data stream.
value | The numeric value of a single measured sample.
time | Unix Time (epoch seconds). This defines the time that a measurement is recorded at. It is useful when sending measurements from multiple hosts to align them on a given time boundary, eg. time=floor(Time.now, 60) to align samples on a 60 second tick.
period | Define the period for the metric. This will be persisted for new metrics and used as the metric period for metrics marked for Service-Side Aggregation.
